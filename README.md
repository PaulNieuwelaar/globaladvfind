This solution adds Advanced Find into the navigation bar next to Global Quick Create.

This Advanced Find button is context sensitive, so if you click it while on a view or form, the advanced find window that opens will automatically take you to the entity you're on.

Note that this is unsupported, and is not guaranteed to work with future releases/rollups of CRM.

v1.1.0.0
- When clicked from a view the advanced find window now opens to that view
